# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Commands

All commands run through `uv` (Python 3.12). Dependencies are in `pyproject.toml`; `uv sync` installs them into `.venv`.

```bash
# Install / update deps (also creates .venv on first run)
uv sync

# First-time: copy env template, then fill in GEMINI_API_KEY
cp .env.example .env

# Postgres + MinIO + bucket bootstrap (matches DATABASE_URL / MINIO_* in .env)
docker compose up -d        # start
docker compose down         # stop (keeps data)
docker compose down -v      # stop and wipe data
# MinIO console: http://localhost:9001 (minioadmin/minioadmin)

# Run the API (reload mode for dev)
uv run uvicorn app.main:app --reload

# Reports pipeline (idempotent; safe to re-run)
uv run python -m app.reports                          # all enabled (source, type)
uv run python -m app.reports --type company --ticker HPG   # one type, one ticker
uv run python -m app.reports --only=extract           # single stage (after a prompt change)

# Lint
uv run ruff check .

# Tests (see "Tests" section below for layout + single-test commands)
uv run pytest
uv run pytest tests/unit -q
uv run pytest tests/integration -q

# Alembic — URL is read from .env via app.core.config, not alembic.ini
uv run alembic revision --autogenerate -m "description"
uv run alembic upgrade head
```

A `.env` is required (copy from `.env.example`). `Settings` (`app/core/config.py`) reads it via `pydantic-settings`. `GEMINI_API_KEY` must be set to **anything non-empty** for the app to serve `/api/v1/agent/...` at all (eager `GeminiClient` init — see Gotchas); a fake key lets routes wire up but real LLM calls then return 502. Postgres is required for the agent layer (it persists conversations + messages); the lifespan only logs a warning if Postgres is unavailable, but `POST /api/v1/agent/{agent_key}/conversations` will fail.

## Architecture

The app is a thin layered service: **HTTP route → Service → external client (LLM / DB)**. Routes do validation + error mapping only; services own the business logic; clients (`GeminiClient`, SQLAlchemy session) are pure transport and raise domain exceptions, never log.

### Dependency injection — single source of truth

Cross-feature singletons live in `app/dependencies.py` — engine, session factory, Gemini, MinIO, settings — all `@lru_cache(maxsize=1)`. Per-request objects (`get_session`) are async generators that handle rollback + close. Feature-local wiring (e.g. building a `ReportSource` for a given source code) lives in `app/<feature>/dependencies.py` and depends on the cross-feature file. Tests override deps via `app.dependency_overrides` in `tests/integration/conftest.py` — see `FakeGeminiClient` / `FakeMinioClient` in `tests/base.py` for the canonical pattern.

The lifespan in `app/main.py` reuses the same `get_engine()` singleton from `dependencies.py` and calls `cache_clear()` after `engine.dispose()` on shutdown so a hot-reloaded process gets a fresh engine.

### Exceptions

Domain exceptions live in `app/core/exceptions.py`, **not** co-located with the code that raises them. `GeminiClient.generate` raises `LLMError`; the agent route catches it and maps to `HTTPException(502)`. New domain exceptions go in `core/exceptions.py` and are imported where needed.

### Feature layout — schemas vs. models

The codebase is feature-based: `app/agent/`, `app/health/`, `app/reports/`. Inside each feature:

- `schemas.py` — Pydantic models for API request/response. This is what FastAPI serializes.
- `models.py` (when the feature owns tables) — SQLAlchemy ORM mapped to `app/models/base.py:Base`. Alembic picks up everything bound to `Base.metadata` via `target_metadata = Base.metadata` in `alembic/env.py`.
- `api.py`, `service.py`/`services/` — route layer + business logic.

Cross-cutting infra stays under `app/core/` (LLM, DB, storage, logging, config, exceptions). API DTOs and ORM models are not interchangeable — don't import a feature's `models.py` into another feature's routes.

### Logging

`app/core/logging/setup.py` configures structlog with two renderers (dev=`ConsoleRenderer`, prod=`JSONRenderer`) and bridges stdlib logging (uvicorn, sqlalchemy) into the same pipeline. The processor chain includes `merge_contextvars`, so anything bound to `structlog.contextvars` automatically appears on every log line.

`app/core/logging/middleware.py` is registered in `main.py` as an HTTP middleware. It honors an incoming `X-Request-ID` header (or mints a UUID4), binds `request_id`/`method`/`path` to contextvars, and echoes the ID back in the response. This means every log line within a request is automatically correlated by `request_id` — you don't need to pass loggers around.

**When to log:** boundary events (service-level start/done, lifecycle, unexpected-but-recovered). **Don't log:** inside `core/llm/` or `core/database/` (raise instead — the caller decides), inside routes (uvicorn already logs the HTTP call), or in hot loops. Log shapes (lengths, IDs), never contents (no PII).

### Reports pipeline (`app/reports/`)

Three idempotent stages, each gated on `Report.status`:
`discovered → downloaded → extracted` (terminal: `duplicate`, `failed`).
Re-runs over already-processed rows do zero work — that's the recovery model.

Two registries, both **explicit**:
- `app/reports/crawlers/` — `ReportSource` ABC + `@register` decorator. Source-specific
  quirks (e.g. mapping our `code='company'` to Vietstock's `reportTypeID='58'`) live on
  the crawler class as ClassVars (see `VietstockSource.TYPE_FILTER`), **never** as
  source-flavored columns on `report_types`. The DB schema stays universal.
  New source = subclass + `@register` + INSERT into `sources`.
- `app/reports/extraction/registry.py` — explicit dict `EXTRACTION_REGISTRY`, keyed
  by the same string as `report_types.code` (the universal type slug — `'company'`,
  `'industry'`, etc.). Each `<key>/` folder pairs `schema.py` (Pydantic +
  `__extraction_key__` + `__version__`) with `prompt.md`.
  New schema = mkdir + 2 files + 1 import + 1 dict line + DB row.

Full design context: `docs/reports-pipeline.md` (gitignored, local only).

### Agent layer (`app/agent/`)

Multi-turn agentic conversations, designed for **N agents** sharing one
runtime. Route → `ConversationService` → per-spec `AgentLoop` →
`GeminiClient.generate_with_tools`. Each user/assistant/tool step persists
as a row in `messages`. `conversations.agent_key` ties a conversation to
the spec that started it; subsequent turns always run on the same agent.

Three explicit registries:
- `app/agent/tools/` — `Tool` ABC + `@register` decorator. The shared tool
  catalog. New tool = subclass + `@register` + import in `tools/__init__.py`.
- `app/agent/agents/` — `AgentSpec` (frozen dataclass) + `register_agent(...)`.
  Each `<key>/` folder pairs `spec.py` (builds + registers the spec) with
  `prompt.md` (the system instruction). The spec declares: `key`,
  `description`, `system_prompt`, `tool_names` (allowlist from the catalog),
  `max_steps`, `per_tool_timeout_s`, `per_turn_timeout_s`,
  `enable_google_search`. New agent = `mkdir agents/<key>/` + `spec.py` +
  `prompt.md` + 1 import in `agents/__init__.py`.
- `app/agent/runtime/loop.py` — the loop itself is **agent-agnostic**.
  Defaults (`MAX_STEPS=10`, per-tool 45s, per-turn 180s) live there; per-spec
  overrides come from `AgentSpec`. On overflow `AgentLoopExceededError` →
  HTTP 504.

Routes are `/api/v1/agent/{agent_key}/...` — the path-param resolves to an
`AgentSpec` via `get_agent_spec`, returning 404 for unknown keys. A
discovery endpoint `GET /api/v1/agent/agents` lists registered agents.
The current Q&A agent is keyed `qa` (`app/agent/agents/qa/`).

### Alembic

Async template. `alembic/env.py` calls `config.set_main_option("sqlalchemy.url", get_settings().database_url)`, so the `sqlalchemy.url` field in `alembic.ini` is intentionally blank. Don't set it there — change `DATABASE_URL` in `.env`.

### Tests

`pytest-asyncio` in `asyncio_mode = "auto"` (configured in `pyproject.toml`), so test functions can be `async def` without decorators.

**Layout — split by what the test exercises, not by what it covers:**

```
tests/
├── base.py                # shared utilities (e.g. FakeGeminiClient) — no fixtures
├── unit/                  # pure, fast, no I/O — service logic with mocked clients,
│                          # schema validation, pure functions in core/. No FastAPI app.
└── integration/           # exercise wiring: HTTP via ASGITransport, real DB session
    ├── conftest.py        # env-var setup BEFORE importing app.main; AsyncClient,
    │                      # app, fake_gemini fixtures; dependency_overrides cleanup
    └── test_*.py          # full request → response, with external clients faked
```

Rules:
- A test that imports `app.main` or constructs an `AsyncClient` is integration. It goes in `tests/integration/`.
- A test that instantiates a service or core class directly (no FastAPI, no real DB) is unit. It goes in `tests/unit/`.
- Shared test doubles (like `FakeGeminiClient`) live in `tests/base.py`. Fixtures live in the relevant `conftest.py` — `tests/integration/conftest.py` for HTTP-layer fixtures.
- Don't import from `tests/integration/` in unit tests, or vice versa.

Run a single test:
```bash
uv run pytest tests/integration/agent/test_conversation_routes.py::test_create_conversation_returns_id_and_agent_key -v
uv run pytest tests/unit -q                  # unit only
uv run pytest tests/integration -q           # integration only
```

## Gotchas

- **Gemini structured output rejects `additionalProperties`** in the JSON schema.
  Pydantic generates that for `dict[str, T]` fields. In any model passed as
  `response_schema` to `GeminiClient.generate_from_pdf`, use `list[NamedMetric]`
  (where `NamedMetric{name: str, value: float}`) instead of `dict[str, float]`.
  See `app/reports/extraction/company/schema.py` for the pattern.

- **All `/api/v1/agent/...` routes need a real `GEMINI_API_KEY`**, even ones that
  don't call the LLM (e.g. `POST /conversations`). `get_conversation_service`
  depends on `get_gemini`, which eagerly constructs `GeminiClient` per request;
  the SDK constructor raises `ValueError` on an empty key. Catches misconfig
  early — but means you can't smoke-test the routing layer without the key.

- **Gemini function-calling requires `thought_signature` on every `function_call` part you re-send.**
  Within an agent turn, append the model's raw `Content` (`response.candidates[0].content`)
  verbatim — it carries the signature. Across turns, drop persisted
  function_call/response rows entirely; the prior assistant *text* already
  summarises what those tools returned. See `app/agent/runtime/loop.py` and
  `app/core/llm/gemini.py:_parse_tool_use_response`.

Guidelines:
- **Title is the why-shaped summary**, not a file list. `feat: add request-ID propagation` not `feat: add middleware.py`.
- **Imperative mood** ("add", "fix", "remove" — not "added"/"adds").
- **Default to title only.** No body for routine changes. Add a body only when the title can't carry the *why* — and even then, keep it short.
- **One logical change per commit.** If you can describe two unrelated things in the message, split it.
- Don't include "AI generated" / co-author trailers unless explicitly asked.
